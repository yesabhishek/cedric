# Cedric - Django App Configuration Made Easy

## Overview

Cedric is a Python library designed to streamline the process of setting up a Django application. This library aims to save development time and simplify the configuration of a full-fledged Django project. By taking a few inputs from the user, Cedric automates the creation and configuration of a Django application, allowing developers to focus on building great features rather than spending time on the initial setup.

## Features

- **Interactive CLI:** Cedric provides an interactive command-line interface (CLI) that guides users through the configuration process with a series of well-defined questions.

- **Default Choices:** Cedric comes with sensible default choices for various configuration options, making the setup process quick and straightforward. Users can customize their choices based on project requirements.

- **Docker Integration:** Cedric supports the use of Docker, allowing developers to choose whether to include Docker in their project setup. The default choice is set to use Docker for enhanced development and deployment consistency.

- **Cloud Provider Options:** Users can select their preferred cloud provider from a list of popular choices, including AWS, GCP, Azure, Linode, or none if the application is not hosted on a specific cloud provider.

- **CSS Framework Selection:** Cedric includes options for selecting a CSS framework. TailwindCSS is set as the default choice, but users can opt for Bootstrap or choose not to include any CSS framework in their project.

- **Database Configuration:** Developers can choose their preferred database from a list that includes Postgres, MySQL, and Sqlite3. Sqlite3 is set as the default choice for simplicity, but users can easily select an alternative option.
